Juan is a Senior Technician in International Trade and currently works in a company dedicated to the import and export of wines. 
It develops its activity mainly in an office, where it carries out different administrative tasks. He also has regular meetings and participates in work groups in the company dedicated to 
developing international projects.

The office where he works is small and he hits his body against the tables and chairs. The floor is quite slippery and the other day when he walked a little faster than usual, he suffered a fall. 
Fortunately, he only had a slight bruise on one arm.

There is no window in the office and therefore no natural light. 
The artificial light is insufficient and as a result, he often has a headache and feels a burning sensation in their eyes. 
The office has no ventilation. The average temperature inside the office is 12 Celsius degrees, and in winter it is difficult to concentrate. 

There is a very old photocopier that produces a constant noise above the 60 decibels, so that it is difficult to have a conversation near her.

The chair that Juan uses is not adjustable and because he is not very tall, he cannot put his feet onto the floor while heâ€™s sitting. 
As he spends many hours in front of the computer screen, he has pain in his wrists. A traumatologist has diagnosed him tendon inflammation.

The electrical installation is very deteriorated. The company's workers asked their boss to put a fire extinguisher in case there was a fire.
The boss does not consider it necessary because the firemen can be warned.
